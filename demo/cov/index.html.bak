<h3> Overview </h3> 
<p>
This paper casts the multi-model fitting problem in terms of set coverage, deriving a simple and effective method that generalizes Ransac to multiple models and deals with intersecting structures and outliers in a straightforward and principled manner, while avoiding the typical shortcomings of sequential approaches and those of clustering.

<h3> Method </h3> 
<p>  
We rely on ``Random sample Coverage'', or <i>RansaCov</i> a simple coverage formulation aimed at retriving from a pool of tentative random models the ones that best explain the data in terms of consensus.<BR>
In particular, given the inlier threhshold as input the multi-model fitting problem is resoved via:
<ul type=”disc”>
 <li><b>Set cover:</b>  extract the smallest number of structures whose consenus sets  cover all elements  </li>
 <li><b>Maximum coverage:</b> search for the largest number of points that can be covered by <i>k</i> consensus sets, possibly leaving some points (the outliers) 			uncovered.<BR>
	This method requires to the user to specify as input also the number of desired structures</li>
</ul>
Both these problems consists in the optimization of a global cost function resorting on consensus, in this way the greediness of techniques such as Sequential/Multi-Ransac and J-linkage are eluded, but at the same time it is also possible to avoid the difficult trade-off between data fidelity and complexity of other formulations.<BR>
Note that we do not require the retrived consensus sets to be disjoint, so RansaCov is not limited to partitions and  can properly handle the case of intersecting structures.
