<h2> Overview </h2> 

<p>
Multi-class cascaded T-Linkage (MCT) is a multi-model recovery framework that tackles the problem of multiple model fitting  when the sought structures can be described by a mixture of <strong>heterogeneous</strong> parametic models drawn from different classes.
The main assumption is that model classes are nested and form a subsumption hierarchy (e.g. circle and line,  fundamental matrix and homography, cylinder and plane).
</p>
<ul>
 <LI>MCT  offers a hierarchical interpretation of data in <em>nested compatible models</em>, which can be biased to serve specific purposes exploiting user provided criteria. Specifically, a cascaded extension of T-linkage sequentially extract simpler nested models starting form the more general ones.</LI>
<LI>Geometric constraints (e.g. tangency between line and circle, or compatibility between homography and fundamental matrix) are enforced to guide the sampling and to break down a complex model selection task into a collection of easier local model selection instances.</LI>
</ul>

<h2>  Method  </h2>

 If A denotes the more general models (circles, fundamental matrices, cylinders...) and B the nested ones (lines, homographies, planes...) 
<ol>
<li>At first T-linkage is performed to retrive A-structures.</li>
<li>Then on every attained A-structure T-linkage recovers nested models of type B enforcing geometric compatibility. </li>
<li>Hence, in a model selection step, models belonging to different classes compete with each other only if they explain the same points. In this way, all the intra-class model selection problems are implicitly dealt by T-linkage, whereas the inter-class model selection issues take explicitly the form of one-vs-many or one-vs-one model comparison, which can be efficiently tackled with classical tools such as GRIC.
</ol>

<h2>  Data  </h2>

These datasets has been created with the goal of providing a benchmark for testing multiple model fitting with heterogenous data. The data is stored in the .MAT file format. Even if we are well awared that <em>models lie in the eye of the beholder</em>, a "ground-truth" segmentation that reflects the hetereogenity of the data is provided for comparison purposes.

<h3> Adelaide Cube FH </h3>


The <strong>Adelaide Cube FH dataset</strong> is comprised of eight stereo pairs (extracted from the <a href="https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/users/hwong/doku.php?id=data"> AdelaideRMF dataset</a>) where a cube togheter with other object undergoes diverse rigid motions. A multi-heterogeneous-model classification of the 2D corresponeces is presented: the 2D point-correspondences are clusterized either accordintg to multiple fundamental matrices (if the corresponding 3D points lie on a generic objet) or with multiple homographies (when the corresponding 3D points lie on one of the face of the cube).
