For this reason I shall precede it with an adjective in order to disambiguate. This page is about <b>perspective rectification</b>, i.e., the removal of perspective effects on a single image, a.k.a. perspective control, or correction. The page for <b>epipolar rectification</b> that operates on a stereo pair and makes it amenable to stereo matching is <a href="index.html">here</a> .		</p>		<hr width="100%">		<h3>			Description		</h3>		<p>			Perspective rectification transforms the original image with a homography such that the image of a reference plane chosen by the user becomes a similarity transform of the real one (instead of a perspective projection). As a result:		</p>		<ul>			<li>all lines that are vertical/horizontal in reality are vertical/horizontal in the rectified image (of the plane) ;			</li>			<li>all lines that are parallel in reality are parallel in the rectified image (of the plane);			</li>			<li>angles are preserved (i.e. can be measured in the image of the plane);			</li>			<li>distances can be measured in the image (of the plane) as soon as the scale is known.			</li>		</ul>		<p>			The reference plane typically is the ground or a facade. As emphasized above, the similarity is valid <b>only</b> for the reference plane. The image of all the other object points (excluding other planes parallel to the reference one) is distorted. This rectified (or controlled) photo is <b>not the same as an orthophoto</b><sup>(*)</sup>. The user can provide input in two ways:		</p>		<ol>			<li>Select 4 pair of points that determine 4 lines (two horizontal and two vertical). The distance between pair of lines can be given in order to scale the image correctly.			</li>			<li>Select 4 points on a rectangle. The dimensions of the rectangle can be given in order to scale the image correctly.			</li>		</ol>		<p>			In any case horizontal and vertical scales are guessed, so that a default is submitted to the user that does not have access to any measure. An independent scaling of the two axes can be easily applied also a-posteriori.		</p>		<hr>		<h3>			Code		</h3>		<p>			The MATLAB <a href="PerspRectificationToolkit.zip">Perspective Rectification Toolkit</a> is based on functions contained in the MATLAB&nbsp; <a href="../toolkit.html">Computer Vision Toolkit</a> by A. Fusiello. The code does not have any other external dependency on toolboxes or packages, and runs indifferently on Octave and Matlab. It has been tested on Octave 4.2.1 and Matlab R2017a.		</p>		<hr width="100%">		<h3>			References		</h3>		Reference [1] is the oldest one on this subject that I could find.
