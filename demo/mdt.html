<h3>Overview</h3>

Augmented Reality deals with the problem of
enhancing the real world with computer generated data; to this end it is
important to determine the pose of a given object with respect to the
camera(s). In this paper we present a technique for tracking complex objects
in video sequences with multiple cameras.  Our method uses information
derived from image gradient by comparing them with the edges of tracked
object, whose 3D model is known. A score function is defined, depending on
the amount of image gradient ``seen'' by the model edges. The sought pose
parameters are obtained by maximizing this function using a non deterministic
algorithm which proved to be optimal for this problem.  In order to provide
at each step a better starting guess and to smooth out noise, a recursive
Kalman filter has been also implemented. We also propose a technique to cope
with cameras with variable focal length. Results with real sequences have
shown small errors in pose estimations and a good behavior in augmented
reality applications.

<h3>Method</h3>

Our tracking algorithm uses image gradient space
compared to model edges. A score function is defined, depending on the amount
of image gradient "seen" by the model edges. Main features are:
<ul>
<li> no image features extraction are necessary;</li>
<li> it is robust to occlusions;</li>

<li> it uses multiple cameras;</li>

<li> it copes with zooming cameras;</li>

<li> a temporal evolution system (Kalman filter) has been implemented;</li>

<li> the optimization algorithm has been carefully chosen;</li>

<li> it implements a vectorial graphic engine with hidden line removal;</li>

<li> it can track every object type (of arbitrary complexity) which can be
rendered by the graphic library OpenGL.
</ul>
